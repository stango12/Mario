# Mario
A Mario Clone

## To Do:
- Get rid of all magic numbers
- Implement Koopas
- Implement Star powerup

## Maybe:
- Goombas collide with each other
- Make and use a TextureAtlas instead of lots of Textures
- Holding x makes Mario run

## Bugs:
- Big Mario can walk through one block high spaces 
- Block logic doesn't work when either small or big Mario jump under one block high blocks
